Abstract Classes in Java
abstract = abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but they can have a subclass
         = abstract methods are declared without an implementation


Following are some important observations about abstract classes in Java.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. An instance of an abstract class can not be created.
  2. Constructors are allowed.
  3. We can have an abstract class without any abstract method.
  4. Abstract classes can not have final methods because when you
     make a method final you can not override it but the abstract
     methods are meant for overriding.
  5. We are not allowed to create object for any abstract class.
  6. We can define static methods in an abstract class
