As the name suggests access modifiers in Java helps to restrict the scope of a class, constructor, variable, method, or data member.
There are four types of access modifiers available in java: 
 1. Default – No keyword required
    -------------------------------
    - The class is only accessible by classes in the same package.
    - This is used when you don't specify a modifier. 
 2. Private
    -------------------------------
    - The methods or data members declared as private are accessible
      only within the class in which they are declared.
    - Any other class of the same package will not be able to access these members.
 3. Protect
    -------------------------------
    - The methods or data members declared as protected
      are accessible within the same package or subclasses in different packages.
    
 4. Public
